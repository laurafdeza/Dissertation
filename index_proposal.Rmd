Rhythm is defined as a pattern of recurrent time intervals that usually occur periodically. This periodic nature allows to predict the start of an interval or the next recurring event based on what has already been perceived

# Research Questions

## Study 1: Linguistic anticipation
	
**RQ1. Do Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Mandarin and English learners of Spanish use lexical stress to anticipate verbal suffixes in Spanish?**      
**If so, are prediction abilities mediated by verbal WM?**

</br>
--
**H1.** Only monolingual and advanced L2 speakers will anticipate <font size="-1">(Lozano et al., 2019; Sagarra & Casillas, 2018)</font>, but L2 will not reach native-like performance <font size="-1">(Perdomo & Kaan, 2019)</font>.
WM will only affect performance in the L2 groups <font size="-1">(Huettig & Mani, 2016; Otten & van Berkum, 2009; Sagarra & Casillas, 2018)</font>.

# Research Questions

## Study 2: Auditory anticipation  
	
**RQ2. Is linguistic prediction of word morphology associated with auditory prediction in Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Chinese and English learners of Spanish?**      
**If so, how do WM, L1 transfer and L2 proficiency mediate this relationship?**

--

**H2.** _Pitch_     
No association between pitch and speech prediction abilities in any group, so L2 proficiency will not be associated either. Mandarin speakers are expected to anticipate melodic information faster than any of the other populations.      
Pitch anticipation scores will be positively correlated with verbal WM scores in non-Mandarin speakers <font size="-1">(Roden et al., 2014)</font>.

**If so, how do WM, L1 transfer and L2 proficiency mediate this relationship?**

**H2.** _Rhythm_      
No relationship in monolinguals.
Better rhythm anticipation abilities are expected to be associatd with individual variability of speech anticipation in L2 participants <font size="-1">(Cason & Schön, 2012)</font>. For L2 speakers, this rhythmic influence on speech anticipation will be visible at all levels of proficiency and regardless of the L1.
WM is only expected to have an effect on rhythm prediction abilities for all speakers <font size="-1">(Colley et al., 2018)</font>.

# Research Questions

## Study 3: Visuospatial anticipation   
	
**RQ3. Is linguistic prediction of word morphology associated with visuospatial prediction in Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Chinese and English learners of Spanish?**      
**If so, how do WM, L1 transfer and L2 proficiency mediate this relationship?**

--

**H3.** Language prediction abilities in the L1 and the L2 are not expected to be associated with the visuospatial domain. 
WM will only be associated with speech L2 anticipation performance, and it might be associated with visuospatial WM due to cross-domain influence <font size="-1">(Colley et al., 2018)</font>. Visuospatial WM performance will in return be associated with visuospatial anticipation <font size="-1">(Pan et al., 2014; Woodman & Luck, 2004)</font>.

# Conclusion

</br>
**Goal:** to examine the role of language experience (L1 transfer, L2 proficiency) (Study 1), non-linguistic auditory prediction (Study 2), and visuospatial prediction (Study 3), on L1 and L2 linguistic prediction of word endings based on prosodic cues, and the mediation of verbal and visuospatial WM.

--
</br>
</br>
**Relevance:** Results would confirm whether different cognitive domains in the auditory modality can influence speech anticipation, and thus if anticipation relies at least partially on domain-general cognitive mechanisms that may be shared within and across modalities, and, therefore, whether better anticipatory abilities in other modalities do not affect linguistic prediction.
