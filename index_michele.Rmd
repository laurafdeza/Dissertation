# Phonomorphological anticipation

## Central Swedish

Low tone + singular: _fisken_ 'fish<sub>[SG]</sub>'     
High tone + plural: _fiskar_ 'fish<sub>[PL]</sub>' <font size="-1">     
(Roll et al., 2010)</font>

## Spanish
First syllable stressed + present: _canta_ 's/he sings'     
First syllable unstressed + preterit: _cantó_ 's/he sang' <font size="-1">     
(Sagarra & Casillas, 2018)</font>

???
Not learned in class so picked up through experience

# Lexical stress-suffix associations

- Spanish, English and Chinese have stress
</br>
</br>
  - Contrastive in Spanish and English; confounded with tones in Chinese

# Lexical stress-suffix associations

- Spanish, English and Chinese have stress
  - Contrastive in Spanish and English; confounded with tones in Chinese
  
- Inflectional morphology in Spanish and English; particles and classifiers in Chinese
  - Spanish richer than English

# The study

## Does verbal WM affect Spanish speakers' ability to make stress-tense suffix predictions?
### If so, how?

## Does the L1 affect verbal WM effects in English and Mandarin Chinese speakers' ability to make stress-tense suffix predictions in L2 Spanish?
### If so, how?
### Does L2 proficiency mediate those effects?

---

# The study

Participants:
- 30 Spanish monolinguals
- 65 English speakers (L2 Spanish intermediate or above)
- 64 Mandarin Chinese speakers (L2 Spanish intermediate or above)

Materials:
- Proficiency test
- Language history questionnaire
- Visual world paradigm (eye-tracking)
- Operation Span task

Analysis:
- Growth Curve Analysis <font size="-1">(Mirman, 2014)</font>

<!--
Oxytones faster > more
High proficiency faster, especially in oxytones
Verbal WM effects at lower or higher prof:
  - low prof: high wm predicts par slower and ox faster than low wm
  - high prof: high wm predicts par faster and ox slower than low wm-->

# Discussion

## Does verbal WM affect Spanish speakers' ability to make stress-tense suffix predictions?
### If so, how?
</br>
--
Yes. Effects vary by tense.

---

# Discussion

## Does the L1 affect verbal WM effects in English and Mandarin Chinese speakers' ability to make stress-tense suffix predictions in L2 Spanish?
### If so, how?
### Does L2 proficiency mediate those effects? 
</br>
--

Yes. L1s and L2 proficiency modulate the influence of verbal WM in phonomorphological prediction. Effects vary also by tense.

---

# Discussion

L1:
- Effects in EN but not in MaCH: more similar languages are more susceptible to verbal WM effects

---

# Discussion

L1:
- Effects in EN but not in MaCH: more similar languages are more susceptible to verbal WM effects
</br>

Proficiency:
- At low proficiency, high WM benefits condition with fewer competitors.
- At high proficiency, more frequent condition is benefited by high WM.

--

Other studies:
- WM does affect L2 phonomorphological processing <font size="-1">(Huettig & Janse, 2016; Lozano-Argüelles et al., under review)</font>
- Different associations may be affected differently <font size="-1">(vs. Otten & Van Berkum, 2009; Sagarra & Casillas, 2018)</font>

Models:
- Usage-based models
- Working memory models

---

# Conclusion

WM effects are mediated by other factors:
- the more similar the languages the stronger the effects;
- proficiency involves also frequency and reliability of associations; and
- association involved in processing
